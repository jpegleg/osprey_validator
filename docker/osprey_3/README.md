# OSPREY 3 ðŸ¦…

End to End protection abstraction prototype on top of JWT for zero-trust service modelling.

Osprey 3 builds on top of osprey 2, adding in an ephemeral CA for mTLS client certificate signing, a PKI component that also requires mTLS to access.

The binary used in Osprey 3 is very similar to the ones we have used in Osprey 2 and 1, see https://github.com/jpegleg/three_pki
